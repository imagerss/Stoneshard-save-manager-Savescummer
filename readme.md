What is it?
Basic Save manager/save scammer for stoneshard

Why?
I really enjoyed StoneShard but found it extremely tedious, mainly to due awulff save system. I get what they tried to do, but it's simply not fun to walk for 10 min then die on first encounter especially if you have limited time for games.

How it works?
Very simply, basically the only way to save a game is to exit the game in order to create a folder called exitsave in your game files. If you then copy this folder, you can paste it over and over in order to load that checkpoint. So there is really no need for any program to do this as you can just copy/paste it manually. All this program does is copy/paste this folder for you, while keeping old saves with timestamps.

How to use?
Lunch main.exe
Start palying the game
if you want to save, you have to press esc-> save&exit
go alt tab to savescummer and click save
go back to the game and keep playing
die
go back to save scummer select save point and click load
go back to the game, click load and select exitsave

Also take note I'm not a developer by any chance, so the code is poorly organized/structured and probably funny to anyone who codes for a living especially since I made it kinda only for personal use, but I figured i my as well make it public. Works on my machine :).
